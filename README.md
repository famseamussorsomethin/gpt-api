\* there are usage limits (you can read more below), but this is super duper flippin niche so they wont be hit. (also from vercel)  
  
  
  This API contains 2 models currently.
  1. gpt-oss-120b
  2. gpt-oss-20b
  
  Currently 120b has less requests able to be made per day, however 20b has less requests to be made in a short amount of time (per minute).

  Both 120b and 20b are smarter than gpt-4o which was the go-to quick model from OpenAI for a while. 
  
  I recommend using this in tools like Kilo Code, or any other IDE that allows for any open ai compatible endpoints. Both models are very good at tool calls.









  i'm pretty bad at readme's ill clean this one up later just try ts out.
